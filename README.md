-> I'm good in React, React-Native, C++, MERN. And currently learning block-chain tech. 
- I ‚ù§ fullstack development beacuse :
"Application dev. has the power to create a big impact from your desk." 

My ü•Ö is to build BCDI, but it's something that needs high authority, so i'm on my 
way to build it by helping peoples  through technology. 

1st Startup is Xoasis (a game based on real life) in 12th, failed !
2nd startup is anaisha, slow down cuz of lack of marketting !
3rd startup .... working on it. 

"You'll never know whan you'll get it, so keep trying!" - me.
